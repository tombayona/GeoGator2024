# Fall 2024
This branch continues the work I started in the Summer of 2024 by expanding on the number of forecast being analyzed from one forecast (the case study of the forecast for a HW event) to 92 forecasts (per model)(spanning the months of june, july, and august). This study will compare the accuracy of GraphCast's, Pangu-Weather's, and FourCastNet's 2 meter temperature forecasts throughout the summer season of 2023. We continue to evaluate the models using the RMSE and Bias as metrics.
